### Notes for Copilot
- Update `implementation_checklist.instructions.md` automatically after adding a new feature or page.
- Each new page or service added should include checklist items under the relevant section.
- Use consistent naming: `snake_case` for files, `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for variables.
- Validate Firebase fields against the defined schema when creating/updating documents.
