  }
}

// Edit Recipe

  final result = await Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => EditRecipePage(recipe: recipe)),
  );
  
  if (result == true) {
    await _loadRecipes(); // ✅ Refreshes recipe list
  }
}
```

**Auto-Refresh After Save:**
- ✅ Automatically reloads recipes from Firebase after add/edit

## 🔄 Data Flow: How Changes Reflect Throughout the App

### When Admin Edits a Recipe:

1. **Edit Recipe Page** → User makes changes → Clicks Save (✓)
2. **Firebase Update** → `RecipeService.updateRecipe()` saves to Firestore
3. **Subcollections Updated** → Ingredients, health_conditions, meal_timing all updated
4. **Cache Cleared** → `_clearCache()` ensures fresh data on next fetch
5. **Manage Recipes Page** → Automatically reloads with `_loadRecipes()`
6. **User Side Updates** → All services that fetch recipes get updated data:
   - ✅ **Meal Plan Page** - Shows updated recipe info when logged
   - ✅ **Recipe Search** - Returns updated recipe in search results
   - ✅ **Meal Suggestions** - AI uses updated recipe data for recommendations
   - ✅ **Nutrition Facts** - Displays updated calories, ingredients, health flags
   - ✅ **Recipe Detail Page** - Shows all updated information

### Data Propagation Example:

```
Admin edits "Chicken Adobo" recipe:
├─ Changes: Increases servings from 4 to 6, adds new ingredient
├─ Saves to Firebase
├─ Cache cleared
└─ Changes reflect in:
    ├─ Manage Recipes Page (admin sees updated recipe immediately)
    ├─ User searches "adobo" (sees updated recipe)
    ├─ User logs meal (new ingredient list shown)
    ├─ AI meal suggestions (uses updated nutrition data)
    └─ Nutrition Facts Page (displays new serving count)
```

## 📝 Code Quality Notes

### Current Status:
- ✅ **No compilation errors**
- ⚠️ **8 deprecation warnings** (non-critical):
  - `withOpacity()` → should use `withValues()` (Flutter 3.33+)
  - `value` in DropdownButtonFormField → should use `initialValue` (Flutter 3.33+)
  - `unnecessary_to_list_in_spreads` (minor optimization)

### These warnings do NOT affect functionality and can be addressed later.
