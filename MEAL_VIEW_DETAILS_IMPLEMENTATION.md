# Meal View Details Page Implementation

## Overview
Created a new dedicated page (`meal_view_details_page.dart`) for viewing complete meal details from the meal plan, similar to the nutrition facts page but without the "Log It" button.

## What Was Changed

### 1. New File Created
**File:** `lib/features/meal_planning/meal_view_details_page.dart`

This is a comprehensive meal details page that displays:
- **Meal Image** - Full image with placeholder fallback
- **Meal Description** - With "Did you know?" fun facts section
- **PAX Selector** - Dropdown to select number of people (1-10)
  - Automatically prefills with user's household size from Firebase
  - All nutrition and ingredient quantities scale based on PAX selection
- **Nutrition Facts** - Complete nutritional breakdown
  - Calories (main display)
  - Macronutrients (Fat, Carbs, Protein, Sodium)
  - Micronutrients (Vitamins A, C, Calcium, Iron, Riboflavin, Niacin, Thiamin)
  - All values calculated and displayed based on selected PAX
- **Ingredients List** - With scaled quantities based on PAX
- **Cooking Instructions** - Full recipe steps with prep time, difficulty, and servings info
- **Health Information** - Safety badges for different health conditions
  - Diabetes
  - Hypertension
  - Obesity/Overweight
  - Underweight/Malnutrition
  - Heart Disease/High Cholesterol
  - Anemia
  - Osteoporosis
  - Healthy (None)
- **Meal Timing Information** - Best time to eat badges
  - Breakfast
  - Lunch
  - Dinner
  - Snack

### 2. Updated Meal Plan Page
**File:** `lib/features/meal_planning/meal_plan_page.dart`

**Changes:**
- Added import for `meal_view_details_page.dart`
- Updated `_viewMealDetails()` method to navigate to `MealViewDetailsPage` instead of `RecipeDetailPage`
- When user taps "View Details" in the meal options bottom sheet, they now see the full details page

## User Flow
1. User opens Meal Plan page
2. User taps on a logged meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack)
3. Bottom sheet appears with options
4. User taps "View Details"
5. **New:** Full-page meal view opens showing:
   - All meal information
   - Scaled nutrition based on household size
   - Complete ingredients list
   - Cooking instructions
   - Health and timing information
6. User can adjust PAX to see scaled values
7. User can scroll through all information
8. User taps back button to return to meal plan

## Key Features
- **Read-Only View** - No "Log It" button, perfect for viewing already-logged meals
- **PAX Scaling** - All nutrition and ingredient quantities automatically adjust
- **User Personalization** - Prefills PAX with user's household size from Firebase
- **Comprehensive Information** - All meal details in one scrollable page
- **Professional UI** - Consistent with app design (green accents, clean cards, proper spacing)
- **Health Awareness** - Displays which conditions the meal is safe for
- **Meal Timing** - Shows best times to eat this meal

## Technical Details
- Uses `PredefinedMeal` model from FNRI data
- Integrates with `UserService` to fetch household size
- Calculates nutrition dynamically based on PAX selection
- Scales ingredient quantities using formula: `(quantity * PAX / baseServings)`
- Responsive layout with proper scroll handling
- Loading states for user data fetch
- Error handling with placeholder fallbacks

## Benefits
1. **Better UX** - Full page view instead of cramped modal dialog
2. **More Information** - Shows all meal details in organized sections
3. **PAX Flexibility** - Users can see nutrition for different household sizes
4. **Consistent Design** - Matches the nutrition facts page styling
5. **Read-Only** - Clear distinction from "Log It" flow (which goes to nutrition_facts_page)

## Files Modified
- ✅ Created: `lib/features/meal_planning/meal_view_details_page.dart` (new file, 920+ lines)
- ✅ Updated: `lib/features/meal_planning/meal_plan_page.dart` (added import and updated navigation)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test viewing details of different meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
2. Test PAX selector with different values (1-10 people)
3. Verify nutrition values scale correctly with PAX changes
4. Test with meals that have fun facts and without
5. Test with meals that have different health conditions
6. Verify back navigation works correctly
7. Test on different screen sizes for responsive layout
