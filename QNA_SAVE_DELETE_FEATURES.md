# Q&A Forum - Save & Delete Features Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the **Save Questions** and **Delete Posts** features for the ForkCast Q&A Forum.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Save Questions Functionality ✅

**User Stories:**
- Users can save interesting questions for later reference
- Users can unsave questions they no longer want to track
- Users can view all their saved questions in one place
- Visual feedback shows which questions are saved

**Implementation Details:**

#### Firebase Schema
- **Collection:** `users/{userId}/saved_questions/{questionId}`
- **Fields:**
  - `question_id`: Reference to qna_questions collection
  - `saved_at`: Timestamp when question was saved

#### QnAService Methods
```dart
// Save a question
Future<void> saveQuestion(String questionId)

// Unsave a question
Future<void> unsaveQuestion(String questionId)

// Check if question is saved
Future<bool> isQuestionSaved(String questionId)

// Get all saved questions
Stream<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getSavedQuestions()
```

#### UI Components
- **Forum Page:** Save/unsave toggle button on each question card
  - Bookmark icon (filled when saved, outline when not saved)
  - Color changes: green when saved, gray when not saved
  - Real-time state tracking with `Map<String, bool>`
  - FutureBuilder for initial saved state loading

- **User Feedback:**
  - Success snackbar: "Question saved!"
  - Remove snackbar: "Question removed from saved"
  - Error handling with descriptive messages

---

### 2. Delete Questions Functionality ✅

**User Stories:**
- Users can delete questions they created
- Delete button only appears on questions the user owns
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions
- Deleting a question also removes all associated answers

**Implementation Details:**

#### Ownership Validation
- Only the question author (matched by `user_id`) can delete the question
- Current user ID tracked with Firebase Auth in component state
- Delete button conditionally rendered: `if (question['user_id'] == _currentUserId)`

#### QnAService Method
```dart
// Delete a question with ownership validation
Future<void> deleteQuestion(String questionId)
```

**Cascading Deletes:**
1. Validates user owns the question
2. Deletes the question document
3. Deletes all answers referencing the question
4. Removes question from all users' saved lists

#### UI Components
- **Forum Page:** Delete button (red trash icon) on owned questions
  - Positioned next to save button in action row
  - Red color indicates destructive action
  - Only visible for question author

- **Confirmation Dialog:**
  - Warning icon and "Delete Question" title
  - Clear message about cascading deletes
  - Two-step confirmation (Cancel / Delete)
  - Red "Delete" button emphasizes action

- **User Feedback:**
  - Success snackbar: "Question deleted successfully"
  - Error handling with descriptive messages

---

### 3. Delete Answers Functionality ✅

**User Stories:**
- Users can delete answers they posted
- Delete button only appears on answers the user owns
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletions

**Implementation Details:**

#### Ownership Validation
- Only the answer author (matched by `expert_id`) can delete the answer
- Current user ID tracked with Firebase Auth in component state
- Delete button conditionally rendered: `if (answer['expert_id'] == _currentUserId)`

#### QnAService Method
```dart
// Delete an answer with ownership validation
Future<void> deleteAnswer(String answerId)
```

#### UI Components
- **Answers Page:** Delete button (red trash icon) on owned answers
  - Positioned before the "more" menu button
  - Red color indicates destructive action
  - Only visible for answer author

- **Confirmation Dialog:**
  - Warning icon and "Delete Answer" title
  - Clear message about permanence
  - Two-step confirmation (Cancel / Delete)
  - Red "Delete" button emphasizes action

- **User Feedback:**
  - Success snackbar: "Answer deleted successfully"
  - Error handling with descriptive messages

---

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
**Forum Page (`qna_forum_page.dart`):**
```dart
// Track saved questions locally for instant UI updates
final Map<String, bool> _savedQuestions = {};

// Track current user for ownership checks
String? _currentUserId;

// Load current user on init
Future<void> _loadCurrentUser() async {
  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  if (user != null) {
    setState(() {
      _currentUserId = user.uid;
    });
  }
}
```

**Answers Page (`qna_answers_page.dart`):**
```dart
// Track current user for ownership checks
String? _currentUserId;

// Load current user on init
Future<void> _loadCurrentUser() async {
  final user = FirebaseAuth.instance.currentUser;
  if (user != null) {
    setState(() {
      _currentUserId = user.uid;
    });
  }
}
```

### Security & Validation
- **Firebase Auth:** All operations require authenticated user
- **Ownership Checks:** Server-side validation in QnAService methods
- **Error Handling:** Try-catch blocks with user-friendly error messages
- **UI Protection:** Delete buttons only shown to content owners

2. Red trash icon appears next to save button
3. User taps delete icon
4. Warning dialog appears with cascading delete info

## Firebase Schema Updates

### Updated Collections
```yaml
users:
  subcollections:
    saved_questions:  # NEW
      documentId: questionId (matches qna_questions)
      fields:
        question_id: reference (→ qna_questions.questionId)
        saved_at: timestamp
```

### Security Considerations
- Users can only save/unsave their own saved_questions
- Users can only delete questions they authored
- Users can only delete answers they authored
- Firebase Security Rules should enforce these constraints
